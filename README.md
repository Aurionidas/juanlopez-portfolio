# Juan David López – Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my data analysis portfolio!  
Here you’ll find a collection of projects where I apply Python, Plotly, Excel, and other tools to explore, analyze, and present data. Each project includes source code, visualizations, and detailed explanations to showcase my technical skills and problem-solving approach.

## 📁 Projects

- 📊 [Titanic Survival Analysis with Plotly](https://github.com/Aurionidas/titanic-analysis-python-plotly)  
  An interactive exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset using Plotly. Includes data cleaning, visual exploration, and survival pattern insights based on gender, class, and fare.

- 🔢 [Numerical Methods in Python](https://github.com/Aurionidas/numerical-methods-python)  
  A collection of algorithm implementations using Python to solve numerical problems in scientific computing. Includes root-finding methods, interpolation, integration, and differential equations.

- 📚 [Python projects](https://github.com/Aurionidas/Python-projects)
  A collection of projects that are going to be added during my learning process of some more specific habilities, like API consumption, web Scraping or even tensors and neural networks

- 🧠 [Automation Projects](https://github.com/Aurionidas/Automations)
  A series of personal projects including different automations with various tools and AI.

- 💻 I created a simple Landing page for this repository with basic HTML and CSS. You can take a look at it [here](https://aurionidas.github.io/Portfolio-Landing/)
